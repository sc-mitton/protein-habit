## Instructions

### Turmeric Rice:

1. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter or coconut oil over medium heat.
2. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
3. Stir in the turmeric powder and cook for 1 minute to release the spices.
4. Add the basmati rice, chicken broth, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.
6. Fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.

### Roasted Veggies:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. On a baking sheet, toss the broccoli florets, sliced bell peppers, and onion with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Roast the vegetables for 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized, tossing halfway through.

### Chicken:

1. While the veggies roast, season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and any additional spices you prefer.
2. Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken breasts for 5-6 minutes per side or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
3. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest before slicing.

### Thai Sauce:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, honey, fish sauce (if using), sesame oil, garlic powder, ginger powder, and water.
2. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more lime juice or honey to balance the flavors.

### Assembling the Bowl:

1. In a bowl, layer the turmeric rice, kale, roasted broccoli, roasted onions, roasted bell peppers, and sliced chicken.
2. Drizzle with the Thai sauce.
3. Top with chopped cashews, shaved carrot, fresh cilantro, and microgreens.
